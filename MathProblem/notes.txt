1) Euclidean algorithm or division method =>
---------------------------------------
Algorithm Steps:
   1. Start with the two numbers a and b for which you want to find the GCD.
   2. Compute the remainder of a divided by b, denoted as r.
   3. Replace a with b and b with r.
   4. Repeat the above steps until the remainder r becomes zero.
   5. The GCD is the non-zero value of b in the last iteration. / non zero value of remainder.

2) LCM (Least Common Multiple) = >
-------------------------------
GCD(A,B)×LCM(A,B)=A×B 
-> LCM(A,B) = (AXB)/GCD(A,B)

3) Armstrong Number =>
--------------------
An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.

4) Palindrome Number =>
-----------------------
A Palindrome number is a number that stays the same when reversed. Example- 121 , 131 , 7 etc.

5) Digital Root Method =>
------------------------
This formula provides a direct and efficient way to calculate the digital root of a number without having to iterate through its digits or perform repeated summation.

dr(n)=n%9

This formula calculates the digital root directly from the remainder when dividing n by 9.
It will give the correct result for most cases but will produce 0 instead of 9 for numbers divisible by 9. We need to handle this case separately.
----------------- 
dr(n)=1+(n−1)%9

This formula ensures that the result is always between 1 and 9.
It handles the case when n is divisible by 9 correctly, giving a digital root of 9 instead of 0.

Let's break down how the formula works:
   1> Subtract 1 from the number n: n-1
      This step shifts the range of possible remainders by 1, so that when we take the modulo operation with 9, we have remainders from 0 to 8 instead of 1 to 9.
   2> Take the modulo 9 of the result: (n-1)%9
      Taking modulo 9 ensures that we get a number between 0 and 8, which corresponds to the possible digital root values 1 to 9.
   3> Add 1 to the result: 1 + (n-1)%9
      This step ensures that we map the range of remainders from 0 to 8 back to the range of digital root values from 1 to 9.

dr(38) = 1+ (38-1)%9 = 1 + 37%9 = 1+1 = 2

5) Prime Number =>
---------------
A number which is only divisible by 1 and that number, is called prime number.
If a number is not prime, it will have atleast one divisor <= sqrt(n), so instead of checking till that number(n), we can check till sqrt(n).
1 and 0 are not prime.

6) Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm =>
----------------------------------------
Finding all prime numbers between 1 and N(inclusive)

Algorithm Steps:
   1> Create a list of numbers: Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to N, where N is the upper limit within which you want to find prime numbers.
   2> Start with the first prime number p=2: Mark p (which is 2 initially) as a prime number.
   3> Mark multiples of p as non-prime: Starting from p^2, mark all multiples of p as non-prime. Since p is prime, its multiples are composite numbers.
   4> Move to the next unmarked number: Find the smallest unmarked number greater than p and set it as the new p. If no such number exists, stop. Otherwise, go to step 3.
   5> Repeat: Repeat steps 3-4 until you have checked all numbers up to N.
   6> Numbers left unmarked are prime: After the algorithm finishes, the unmarked numbers that remain in the list are prime numbers.
