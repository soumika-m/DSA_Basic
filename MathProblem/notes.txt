1) Euclidean algorithm or division method =>
---------------------------------------
Algorithm Steps:
   1. Start with the two numbers a and b for which you want to find the GCD.
   2. Compute the remainder of a divided by b, denoted as r.
   3. Replace a with b and b with r.
   4. Repeat the above steps until the remainder r becomes zero.
   5. The GCD is the non-zero value of b in the last iteration. / non zero value of remainder.

2) LCM (Least Common Multiple) = >
-------------------------------
GCD(A,B)×LCM(A,B)=A×B 
-> LCM(A,B) = (AXB)/GCD(A,B)

3) Armstrong Number =>
--------------------
An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.
